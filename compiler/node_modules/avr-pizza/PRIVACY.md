# Privacy Policy

## General

The cloud compilation feature in this software involves using a remote computer (ie. not owned by you, the user) to process the files you provide when using avr-pizza.
We store the least amount of data required to deliver your pizza (compiled code).

**Here is what we do store:**

1. Server logs (timestamps of individual requests, and anonymized errors/stack traces for debugging purposes)
2. Access logs (IP addresses)

**What we don't store:**

1. Your uploaded files - they are deleted immediately after the compilation and return response is completed.
